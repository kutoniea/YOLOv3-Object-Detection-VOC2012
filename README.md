The project is trained with YOLOv3 model based on VOC2012 data.
The YOLOv3 is based on darknet model.

First, set up darknet with cuda environment.
Second, download the data online and read the data.
Third, preprocess the data, transform the annotation file to YOLO format and prepare annotation related iamges.
Fourth, update cfg file to customised dataset.
Fifth, create training, validating, and testing datasets.
Sixth, train the model.
Seventh, evaluate the performance (mAP) and test on images.
